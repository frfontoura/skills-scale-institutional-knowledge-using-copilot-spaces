## OctoAcme Project Management Approach — Summary

OctoAcme projects follow a structured, iterative management style focused on delivering customer value, clear roles, and continuous improvement.

- **Lifecycle:** Initiation → Planning → Execution → Release → Retrospective
- **Core Principles:** Customer-first, iterative delivery, clear ownership, data-informed decisions, and psychological safety
- **Core Roles:** Product Manager, Project Manager, Developer, QA/Testing, Stakeholder
- **Key Artifacts:** One-pager, roadmap, backlog, risk register, release plans, retrospectives

Our approach includes clear communication cadence, strong risk management, and actionable artifact templates and checklists at every phase.
